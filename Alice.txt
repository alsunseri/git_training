Hi! I'm Alice. I'm a file someone added to this repository a while ago.
On branch change_alice
On branch change_alice again... this time to test  "git push --set-upstream origin change_alice," 



Merging divergent branches  - Let's try something more complex. 
... changed Bob.txt

Then git checkout change_alice, change Alice.txt and commit.

In the diagram below you see how our commit history now looks. Both master and change_alice originated from the same commit, but since then they diverged, each having their own additional commit.
