Hi! I'm Alice. I'm a file someone added to this repository a while ago.
On branch change_alice
On branch change_alice again... this time to test  "git push --set-upstream origin change_alice," 



Merging divergent branches  - Let's try something more complex. 
... changed Bob.txt

Then git checkout change_alice, change Alice.txt and commit.

In the diagram below you see how our commit history now looks. Both master and change_alice originated from the same commit, but since then they diverged, each having their own additional commit. 



Rebasing When you've added a commit to the branch, get back to master, make a change and commit it. I added some more text to Alice.txt.  

now in master..  editing in github ( not locally via vim / sublime/ eclipse ) 
Go to your fork of this repo on github.com and open the Alice.txt file.
Find the edit button and make and commit a change via the website. 

.... not in the tutorial -  push before  ... 
trying again to track remote vs local changes 
Trying this again after pushing older ( local ) commits - editing Alice.txt on github website

OK- this is a change on the website to the remote Alice.txt.


Ok that sorta worked - but git fetch still is not showing what it should? 
Anyway - these 2lines are local changes to be stashed and committed after the NEXT pull - after remote changes....

##### Pulling with Conflicts  -remote change to redo above steps in next section....

Pulling with Conflicts  - doing the local stash again because the tutorial did not say "Do not push the commit " untill the next section - 
after I did a git push to master
