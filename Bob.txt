test change after repo rename

$ git push
warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value has changed in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the traditional behavior, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behavior now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.





 want to see the changes we just staged, so let's show the git diff again! 
 You'll notice that this time the output is empty. 
 This happens because git diff operates on the changes in your Working Directory only.





To show what changes are staged already, we can use git diff --staged
